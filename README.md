We are Siddharth Singh, Raj Mehta, and Ranjit Pandey, three passionate Indian students. Cricket is a sport that occupies a particular place in all of our hearts and one that we all deeply enjoy. One of the most well-liked sports in India is the bat-and-ball game of cricket, which is renowned for its dramatic contests and great players.

Cricket is appealing to us because it is more than just a game; it is a component of our culture and identity. It promotes a feeling of enthusiasm and solidarity by bringing people together. We have come together as a team because of our shared passion for this game to learn more about its many features.
