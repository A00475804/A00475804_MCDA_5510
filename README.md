Goal: This program is designed to traverse directories. When it encounters any CSV files, it will parse and consolidate the data into a single CSV file.

How to Run: The program will prompt you to input the path containing the data.
Then it will ask for Output file path and log file path as well
After you provide the all paths, it will execute and display the paths of the resulting CSV file and log file in the console. The output folder is already created in the GIT repository.

paths can also be provided in the code in DirWalker file.

Incomplete Data criteria: I have used a null check to find the incomplete data and validated email as well.
